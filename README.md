<a href="kodi.tv">KODI<a> / XBMC / Firestick addon for the <a href="https://www.reason.com/">Reason.com</a> podcasts<br>

Founded in 1968, Reason is the planet&#8217;s leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Hosted by Nick Gillespie, Matt Welch, and other Reason journalists, our podcast explores &#8220;free minds and free markets.&#8221; It features provocative, in-depth interviews with authors, comedians, filmmakers, musicians, economists, scientists, business leaders, and elected officials. Keep up to date on the latest happenings in our increasingly libertarian world from a point of view you won&#8217;t get from legacy media and boring old left-right, liberal-conservative publications.<br>
